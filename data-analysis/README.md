# 📊 Data Analysis

> Geospatial analysis tools, libraries, and workflows for Python, R, and beyond.

This module covers the full analysis stack: from core libraries and spatial statistics to machine learning pipelines and reusable workflow templates. Whether you work primarily in Python or R, you will find curated recommendations, comparison tables, and ready-to-adapt templates here.

## Key Highlights

- **Python vs R comparison** — side-by-side tables so you can choose the right tool for your task.
- **ML integration** — practical guidance on applying machine learning to geospatial problems, from Random Forest to transformer models.
- **Reusable workflow templates** — five end-to-end analysis workflows with objectives, data requirements, tool recommendations, and expected outputs.

## Quick Start

If you are new to geospatial analysis:

1. **Pick a language** — read [Python Stack](python-stack.md) or [R Stack](r-stack.md) to set up your environment.
2. **Learn the fundamentals** — [Spatial Statistics](spatial-statistics.md) covers the core concepts.
3. **Try a workflow** — [Workflow Templates](workflow-templates.md) walk you through complete analyses step by step.
4. **Scale with ML** — [ML for GIS](ml-gis.md) shows how to integrate machine learning when traditional methods are not enough.
