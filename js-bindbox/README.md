# 🌐 JS Bindbox

> JavaScript libraries and frameworks for web-based geospatial development.

## What is "Bindbox"?

**Bindbox** = **Bind**ing tool**box** / sand**box** for JavaScript geospatial libraries. This module serves as your curated toolkit for discovering, comparing, and integrating the JS libraries that power modern web mapping applications. Think of it as a sandbox where every geo library is just a binding away.

## Table of Contents

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [2D Mapping Libraries](2d-mapping.md) | Leaflet, MapLibre GL JS, OpenLayers and more |
| [3D Mapping & Globe](3d-mapping.md) | CesiumJS, deck.gl, Three.js for 3D geospatial |
| [Spatial Analysis in JS](spatial-analysis.md) | Turf.js, JSTS, Proj4js, spatial indexing |
| [Charting Integration](charting-integration.md) | D3.js geo, ECharts, Plotly.js map components |
| [Tile Servers](tile-servers.md) | Self-hosted and cloud tile serving solutions |

## Key Highlight

Each sub-page provides **side-by-side comparisons** with code examples so you can evaluate libraries quickly. You will find:

- Feature comparison tables
- Decision flowcharts for library selection
- Quick-start code snippets
- Performance and bundle-size considerations

## How to Use This Module

1. Start with the comparison tables to narrow your choices.
2. Follow the decision flowcharts for guided selection.
3. Use the quick-start snippets to prototype.
4. Combine libraries across pages (e.g., MapLibre + Turf.js + D3 charting).
