## Preprint Servers

Preprint servers allow you to share your work before formal peer review, establishing priority and getting early feedback.

| Server | Scope | Cost | DOI | Best For |
|--------|-------|------|-----|----------|
| EarthArXiv | Earth and planetary sciences | Free | Yes | GIS and remote sensing preprints |
| ESSOAr (Earth and Space Science Open Archive) | AGU journals | Free | Yes | AGU-affiliated research |
| arXiv | General science (cs.CV, cs.AI) | Free | No (but has arXiv ID) | GIS + machine learning papers |
| SSRN | Social sciences | Free | Yes | GIS + urban/social applications |
| Preprints.org | Multidisciplinary | Free | Yes | General GIS preprints |

### Preprint-to-Journal Workflow

1. Submit to a preprint server (EarthArXiv recommended for GIS/RS)
2. Receive a DOI within 1-2 days
3. Share the preprint for early feedback
4. Submit to a journal (most GIS journals accept papers with preprints)
5. After acceptance, update the preprint with a link to the published version
6. Check journal policy on Sherpa Romeo before posting

## Tips for Choosing a Journal

1. **Match scope first**: Read recent issues to ensure your topic fits
2. **Consider impact factor**: Higher IF journals are more competitive but more visible
3. **Check review time**: Important if you have deadlines (e.g., tenure clock)
4. **Open access requirements**: Some funders mandate OA publication
5. **Audience**: GIS community vs. domain-specific vs. interdisciplinary
6. **Page charges and APCs**: Budget for publication costs

### Journal Selection Decision Tree

```
Is your paper primarily about a NEW METHOD/ALGORITHM?
  YES --> Is it deep learning / ML focused?
            YES --> TGRS, JSTARS, or RSE
            NO  --> IJGIS, Computers & Geosciences, or Geoinformatica
  NO  --> Is it an APPLICATION paper?
            YES --> Does it use remote sensing data?
                      YES --> RSE, ISPRS J-PARS, or JAG
                      NO  --> IJGIS, Transactions in GIS, or domain journal
            NO  --> Is it a REVIEW/SURVEY?
                      YES --> Earth-Science Reviews, IJGIS, or RSE
                      NO  --> Is it a SOFTWARE/TOOL paper?
                                YES --> JOSS, Computers & Geosciences, or JORS
                                NO  --> Consider the target audience and scope
