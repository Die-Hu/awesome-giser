# Journal Submission Guide

A practical guide to navigating the journal submission process for GIS research papers. Covers pre-submission preparation, journal selection strategy, editorial systems, cover letters, peer review navigation, responding to reviewers, revision strategies, and post-acceptance workflow.

> **Quick Picks**
> - **First step:** Read the journal's aims & scope + recent issues before submitting
> - **Avoid desk rejection:** Match scope, follow formatting, include data/code statements
> - **Faster publication:** Submit to mid-tier journals (3-6 months total) or post a preprint
> - **Responding to reviewers:** Address every point, show what changed with page/line numbers
> - **Post-acceptance:** Share on EarthArXiv, update ORCID, set up Google Scholar alerts

## Journal Selection Strategy

### Scope Matching (Most Important Factor)

The most common reason for desk rejection is scope mismatch. Before submitting:

1. Read the journal's aims and scope statement carefully
2. Check the last 2 years of publications for similar topics
3. Verify your methodology aligns with what the journal publishes
4. Look at your reference list — where are most cited papers published?
5. Check if the journal has published on your specific subtopic

### Impact Factor Strategy

| Journal Tier | IF Range (GIS) | Competition | Review Time | Audience |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Top tier | > 8.0 | Very high (~15-20% acceptance) | 3-6 months | Broad scientific community |
| High tier | 3.0-8.0 | High (~25-30%) | 2-4 months | GIS/RS specialists |
| Mid tier | 1.0-3.0 | Moderate (~35-40%) | 2-3 months | GIS practitioners |
| Entry tier | < 1.0 | Lower (~40-50%) | 1-3 months | Specialized communities |

### Journal Selection Decision Matrix

| Factor | Weight | How to Assess |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Scope match | **Critical** | Read aims & scope, recent issues |
| Audience | **High** | Who needs to read your work? |
| Impact factor | Medium | JCR, SCImago |
| Open access | Variable | Check funder mandates |
| Review time | Variable | Ask colleagues, check journal stats |
| Acceptance rate | Medium | Higher IF = lower acceptance |
| APC cost | Low-Medium | Budget for publication fees |
| Prestige | Medium | Reputation in your subfield |

### Cascade Strategy

```
1. Submit to your TOP CHOICE journal (stretch)
   ├── Accepted → 🎉
   └── Rejected → Use feedback to improve
2. Submit to HIGH TIER journal (realistic)
   ├── Accepted → 🎉
   └── Rejected → Use feedback to improve
3. Submit to MID TIER journal (safe)
   └── Usually accepted after revision

Strategy Tips:
- Max 3 submission rounds to avoid staleness
- Improve the paper between each submission
- Each rejection gives you reviewer feedback (use it!)
- Don't wait too long between submissions
- Post a preprint for visibility during the process
```

### Transfer Options

Many publishers offer manuscript transfer between journals:
- **Elsevier**: Can transfer rejected manuscripts to another Elsevier journal
- **Springer Nature**: Transfer desk suggests alternatives
- **Taylor & Francis**: Transferred reviews may be reused
- **IEEE**: Can transfer between IEEE journals

## Responding to Reviewers

### Golden Rules

1. **Be respectful and professional** — even if reviews feel unfair
2. **Address every single point** — even minor ones
3. **Quote the reviewer's comment** — then provide your response
4. **Show what changed** — reference specific page/line numbers, highlight changes
5. **When you disagree** — provide evidence and polite rationale
6. **Never ignore comments** — unaddressed comments = carelessness signal
7. **Respond quickly** — faster response = faster re-review

### How to Handle Difficult Reviewer Comments

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Reviewer misunderstood your method | Revise the text for clarity; don't blame the reviewer |
| Reviewer asks for impossible experiments | Explain why it's not feasible; offer alternative evidence |
| Reviewer recommends their own papers | Cite if relevant; politely decline if not |
| Reviewer's comment is factually wrong | Respectfully correct with evidence and citations |
| Two reviewers contradict each other | Explain to the editor; choose the better approach |
| Reviewer says "not novel enough" | Add comparison with SOTA; strengthen introduction |
| Reviewer requests complete rewrite | If major revision: do it; if reject: submit elsewhere |

### Common Reviewer Requests and Responses

| Request | Typical Response |
|---------|-----------------|
| "Add more recent references" | Add 3-5 papers from last 2 years |
| "Clarify methodology" | Add step-by-step description or workflow figure |
| "Compare with more baselines" | Add 1-2 comparison methods with results |
| "Discuss limitations" | Add dedicated limitations paragraph |
| "Improve figure quality" | Regenerate at higher resolution |
| "Justify parameter choices" | Add sensitivity analysis or cite prior work |
| "English needs improvement" | Get professional editing |
| "Why this study area?" | Strengthen justification in Study Area section |
| "Include ablation study" | Add experiments removing components one by one |
| "How does this generalize?" | Test on additional dataset or discuss transferability |

---

## Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Frequency | How to Avoid |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Out of scope | Very common | Read aims & scope; check recent publications |
| Insufficient novelty | Common | Clearly articulate what's new; compare with SOTA |
| Poor methodology | Common | Reproducible details; justify choices; validate |
| Weak validation | Common | Appropriate metrics; multiple baselines; ground truth |
| Overclaiming | Common | Match conclusions to evidence; discuss limitations |
| Poor writing | Moderate | Get feedback; use editing services; AI tools |
| Incomplete literature review | Moderate | Cover recent work; systematic search |
| Data not accessible | Growing | Share data/code or explain why not |
| Poor figures | Moderate | Follow journal guidelines; use vector formats |
| Ethical concerns | Rare | IRB approval; proper attribution; cite sources |

### Avoiding Desk Rejection

```
Top 5 desk rejection causes and fixes:
1. Scope mismatch → Check journal aim/scope + recent issues
2. Formatting violations → Use journal template exactly
3. Missing statements → Include data, code, conflict, CRediT
4. Poor English → Get native speaker review or editing service
5. Duplicate submission → Never submit to two journals simultaneously
```

## Open Peer Review

### Models of Open Review

| Model | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Open identities | Reviewer names published | Some Copernicus journals |
| Open reports | Reviews published alongside paper | ESSD, F1000Research |
| Open participation | Community can comment | F1000Research |
| Post-publication review | Comments after publication | PubPeer, Copernicus |
| Registered reports | Design reviewed before results | Some ecology journals |

### Journals with Open Review (GIS-relevant)

| Journal | Open Review Type | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| ESSD | Open discussion + review | 8-week public discussion period |
| GMD | Open discussion + review | Same as ESSD |
| F1000Research | Full open review | Reviews published, post-pub revision |
| PeerJ | Optional open review | Authors choose to publish reviews |
| MDPI journals | Optional open review | Reviewers can choose to sign |
| Nature Communications | Optional open review | Since 2016 |

### Writing as a Reviewer

If asked to review a GIS paper, follow these guidelines:

```
Structure your review:
1. Summary (2-3 sentences of what the paper does)
2. Strengths (what the paper does well)
3. Weaknesses (major concerns)
4. Minor comments (typos, clarifications, suggestions)
5. Questions for the authors
6. Recommendation (accept/minor/major/reject)

Be constructive:
- Explain WHY something is a problem, not just that it is
- Suggest specific improvements
- Cite relevant papers the authors may have missed
- Be fair: would you want this feedback on your own paper?
```

---

## Post-Acceptance Workflow

### Proof Stage

- Review proofs within deadline (typically 48-72 hours)
- Check figures for color accuracy and resolution
- Verify author names, affiliations, acknowledgments
- Correct only errors — don't make substantive changes
- Check that supplementary material is correct
- Verify DOIs and URLs in references

### Promotion Strategy

```
Immediately after publication:
□ Update ORCID profile
□ Update Google Scholar profile
□ Upload to ResearchGate (check publisher policy)
□ Post preprint version on EarthArXiv (if allowed)
□ Share on X/Twitter with visual abstract
□ Post on LinkedIn with plain-language summary
□ Email to colleagues and collaborators

Within 1 month:
□ Write a blog post explaining findings
□ Create a 5-minute video summary
□ Present at lab meeting or department seminar
□ Share in relevant mailing lists/communities (GIS-L, etc.)
□ Submit to conference for presentation

Ongoing:
□ Monitor Google Scholar citation alerts
□ Respond to questions from readers
□ Consider follow-up studies
□ Update data/code repositories if needed
```

### Visual Abstract

Many journals now accept visual abstracts (graphical summaries).

```
Structure of a visual abstract:
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐

## Ethical Considerations

### Authorship Ethics (ICMJE Criteria)

All authors must meet ALL of these criteria:
1. Substantial contribution to conception/design, or data, or analysis
2. Drafting or critically revising the manuscript
3. Approval of the final version
4. Accountability for all aspects of the work

### Common Ethical Issues

| Issue | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Gift authorship | Don't add authors who didn't contribute |
| Ghost authorship | Don't omit contributors |
| Salami slicing | Don't split one study into many papers |
| Duplicate publication | Don't publish the same work twice |
| Self-plagiarism | Don't reuse your own text without citation |
| Data fabrication | Never fabricate or falsify data |
| Image manipulation | Don't alter figures to misrepresent results |
| AI disclosure | Disclose AI tool usage as required by journal |

### Data and Code Availability

```
Strong statement (recommended):
"The source code is available at https://github.com/[user]/[repo]
(DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX). The datasets are available at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXX."

Limited availability (acceptable if justified):
"The data that support the findings of this study are available
from [source] but restrictions apply to their availability, which
were used under license for the current study. Data are available
from the authors upon reasonable request with permission of [source]."

No data sharing (must justify):
"Due to privacy regulations / national security restrictions,
the data cannot be shared. Aggregated results are provided in
the supplementary material."
```
