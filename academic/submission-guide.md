# Submission Guide

A practical guide to navigating the journal submission process for GIS research papers. From pre-submission preparation through post-acceptance, this guide covers checklists, templates, and strategies to improve your chances of successful publication.

> **Quick Picks**
> - **First step:** Read the journal's aims & scope + recent issues before submitting
> - **Avoid desk rejection:** Match scope, follow formatting, include data/code statements
> - **Faster publication:** Submit to mid-tier journals (3-6 months total) or post a preprint
> - **Responding to reviewers:** Address every point, show what changed with page/line numbers
> - **Post-acceptance:** Share on EarthArXiv, update ORCID, set up Google Scholar alerts

## Choosing the Right Journal

### Scope Matching

The most common reason for desk rejection is submitting to a journal outside the paper's scope. Before submitting:

1. Read the journal's aims and scope statement carefully
2. Check recent issues (last 2 years) for similar topics
3. Verify that your methodology aligns with what the journal publishes
4. Look at your reference list -- where are most of your cited papers published?

### Impact Factor Considerations

| Journal Tier | IF Range (GIS) | Competition | Review Time | Typical Audience |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Top tier | > 8.0 | Very high | 3-6 months | Broad scientific community |
| High tier | 3.0 - 8.0 | High | 2-4 months | GIS/RS specialists |
| Mid tier | 1.0 - 3.0 | Moderate | 2-3 months | GIS practitioners and researchers |
| Entry tier | < 1.0 | Lower | 1-3 months | Specialized communities |

### Journal Recommendations by Tier

| Tier | Journals | Typical Topics |
|---|---|---|
| Top (IF > 8) | RSE, ISPRS J-PARS, Nature Geoscience, TGRS | Novel methods, global-scale studies, breakthrough findings |
| High (IF 3-8) | IJGIS, C&G, JAG, GIScience & RS, JSTARS | Solid methodology papers, significant applications |
| Mid (IF 1-3) | Transactions in GIS, Geoinformatica, CaGIS, J. Spatial Science | Regional studies, GIS applications, cartography |
| Entry (IF < 1) | Annals of GIS, Geo-spatial Info Science | Case studies, incremental contributions, conference extensions |

### Decision Factors

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Scope match | Critical | Poor scope match = desk rejection |
| Audience | High | Who needs to read your work? |
| Impact factor | Medium | Important for career, but not everything |
| Open access | Variable | Check funder mandates |
| Review time | Variable | Important if deadline-driven |
| Acceptance rate | Medium | Higher IF generally means lower acceptance |
| Publication fee | Low-Medium | Budget for APCs if needed |

## Responding to Reviewers

### General Strategies

- **Be respectful and professional**, even if reviews feel unfair
- **Address every point** raised by every reviewer, even minor ones
- **Quote the reviewer's comment** then provide your response
- **Show what changed**: reference specific page/line numbers and highlight changes
- **When you disagree**, provide evidence and a clear, polite rationale
- **Do not ignore comments** -- unaddressed comments signal carelessness

## Common Rejection Reasons and How to Avoid Them

| Rejection Reason | How to Avoid |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Out of scope | Read aims & scope carefully; check recent publications |
| Insufficient novelty | Clearly articulate what is new; compare with state-of-the-art |
| Poor methodology | Provide reproducible details; use accepted methods; justify choices |
| Weak validation | Use appropriate accuracy metrics; compare against baselines |
| Overclaiming | Match conclusions to evidence; acknowledge limitations |
| Poor writing quality | Get feedback before submission; use editing services |
| Incomplete literature review | Cover recent work; use systematic search strategy |
| Data not accessible | Share data/code or explain why not; provide metadata |
| Figures not publication quality | Follow journal guidelines; use vector formats |
| Ethical concerns | Obtain IRB approval if needed; cite data sources properly |

### Tips for Faster Publication

- Submit to journals with quick review times if deadline-driven
- Respond to reviews within 2 weeks for best re-review turnaround
- Format correctly the first time to avoid desk rejection for formatting
- Suggest qualified reviewers to speed up the review assignment process
- Consider publishing a preprint for immediate visibility while under review
