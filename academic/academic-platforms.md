## Preprint Servers

### Why Post Preprints?

```
Benefits:
✅ Establish priority (timestamp your discovery)
✅ Get early feedback before journal submission
✅ Immediate visibility (no 6-12 month wait)
✅ Free and open access forever
✅ DOI for citation before formal publication
✅ Required/encouraged by many funders (Plan S)
✅ Preprints are indexed by Google Scholar

Concerns addressed:
❓ "Will journals accept my preprint?"
   → Yes: 95%+ of GIS journals accept papers with preprints
❓ "Will it be scooped?"
   → Preprint timestamp proves your priority
❓ "Is it peer-reviewed?"
   → No, but moderated for basic quality
```

Submission: https://eartharxiv.org/submit

Process:
1. Create account at eartharxiv.org
2. Upload manuscript PDF
3. Add metadata (title, authors, abstract, keywords)
4. Select discipline: "GIS" / "Remote Sensing" / "Cartography"
5. Moderation check (1-2 business days)
6. DOI assigned, publicly available

After journal acceptance:
→ Update EarthArXiv record with:
  - Link to published version
  - "Published in [Journal Name]"
  - DOI of published version

## Manuscript Hosting & Collaborative Platforms

### Platform Comparison

| Platform | Purpose | Cost | Features |
|----------|---------|------|----------|
| Authorea | Collaborative writing + hosting | Free / $10/mo | WYSIWYG + LaTeX, auto-formatting, preprint, submit to journals |
| Overleaf | Collaborative LaTeX | Free / $15/mo | Real-time LaTeX, templates, Git sync |
| Typst.app | Modern typesetting | Free | Fast compilation, real-time collaboration |
| ResearchEquals | Modular publishing | Free | Publish individual research modules |
| Manuscripts.io | Collaborative writing | Free / paid | Structured authoring, submission integration |
| HackMD | Markdown collaboration | Free / $5/mo | Real-time Markdown, presentation mode |
| Google Docs | General writing | Free | Easy collaboration, comments |

### Authorea — Write, Host, Submit

```
URL: https://www.authorea.com

Key features:
- Write in LaTeX, Markdown, or rich text
- Collaborative editing with version history
- Auto-format to 10,000+ journal styles
- Built-in citation management
- Embed figures, data, code, interactive content
- Publish as preprint directly
- Submit to journals without reformatting
- Free for public documents

Workflow:
1. Write collaboratively on Authorea
2. Auto-format to target journal style
3. Publish as preprint on Authorea (DOI assigned)
4. Submit to journal directly from platform
5. After acceptance, Authorea version links to published
```

### ResearchEquals — Modular Publishing

```
URL: https://www.researchequals.com

Concept: Publish individual research modules (not just full papers)
- Research question → Module
- Literature review → Module
- Dataset → Module
- Analysis code → Module
- Results → Module
- Each module gets a DOI
- Modules can be linked, cited, reviewed independently

Why this matters for GIS:
- Share a methodology before results are ready
- Publish a dataset with proper citation
- Share negative results (important but unpublishable)
- Build a portfolio of research contributions
- Get credit for all parts of research, not just papers
```

### PREreview — Community Preprint Review

```
URL: https://prereview.org

How it works:
1. Find a preprint on EarthArXiv/arXiv/etc.
2. Write a structured review on PREreview
3. Review is published openly with your name
4. Author gets feedback before journal submission

Benefits:
- Get feedback on preprints you've posted
- Build your review portfolio (visible on profile)
- Train ECRs in peer review skills
- Improve preprints before journal submission
- Community-driven quality control

PREreview structured template:
□ Summary of the preprint
□ Major strengths
□ Major weaknesses
□ Minor comments
□ Suggestions for improvement
□ Overall assessment
```

### F1000Research — Publish First, Review After

```
URL: https://f1000research.com

Unique model:
1. Submit manuscript → Published within ~7 days (after basic checks)
2. Invited reviewers write open, named reviews
3. Authors can revise based on reviews
4. Once 2+ reviewers approve → Indexed in Scopus, PubMed

Advantages:
- Fastest time to publication
- Transparent review process
- No rejection for negative results
- Reviews are published and citable
- Articles can be revised and re-reviewed

For GIS: Gates Open Research and Wellcome Open Research
use the same F1000 platform and model.
```

### Peer Community In (PCI) — Free Overlay Journals

```
URL: https://peercommunityin.org

How it works:
1. Post preprint on EarthArXiv/arXiv/etc.
2. Submit to relevant PCI (e.g., PCI Ecology, PCI Archaeology)
3. PCI provides free, rigorous peer review
4. If "recommended" → Published as PCI-recommended preprint
5. Can also submit recommended preprint to partner journals

Relevant PCIs:
- PCI Ecology → Environmental GIS
- PCI Archaeology → Archaeological GIS
- PCI Mathematical & Computational Biology → Spatial modeling
- PCI Genomics → Landscape genomics / phylogeography

Cost: Completely free (no APC, volunteer reviewers)
Advantage: High-quality review without journal submission
```

### Review Commons — Portable Peer Review

```
URL: https://www.reviewcommons.org

Concept:
- Submit your manuscript for peer review BEFORE choosing a journal
- Get independent reviews
- Take reviews + manuscript to any partner journal
- Journal decides based on existing reviews (no re-review)

Benefits:
- Review once, submit anywhere
- Saves time (no redundant reviews)
- Reviews are portable
- Partnered with 17+ journals including Nature, EMBO, etc.

GIS relevance: Not yet common in GIS, but growing model

institution to collect, preserve, and provide open access to the
intellectual output of its members.

Common platforms:
- DSpace (most popular, open source)
- EPrints (open source)
- Fedora + Samvera (advanced, open source)

- Invenio (CERN, used by Zenodo)

What to deposit:
- Accepted manuscripts (green OA)
- Theses and dissertations
- Technical reports
- Conference presentations
- Datasets
- Software
```

### Self-Archiving Workflow

```
1. Paper accepted by journal
2. Check Sherpa Romeo for self-archiving policy:
   https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/
3. Determine which version you can deposit:
   - Preprint (submitted version) → Usually OK anytime
   - Postprint (accepted manuscript) → Usually OK after embargo
   - Publisher PDF → Usually NOT allowed
4. Deposit in:
   - Institutional repository (university library)
   - Subject repository (EarthArXiv)
   - Funder repository (if required)
5. Add metadata: title, authors, journal, DOI, embargo date
```

## Overlay Journals & New Publishing Models

### What Are Overlay Journals?

```
Traditional journal:
  Manuscript → Journal submission → Review → Publication (on journal site)

Overlay journal:
  Preprint (on EarthArXiv/arXiv) → Overlay journal review → Recommendation
  → Preprint remains on preprint server, overlay adds review + endorsement

Benefits:
- No APC (reviewer labor is volunteer)
- Fast (preprint already available)
- Transparent (reviews often published)
- Low cost to operate

Examples:
- Discrete Analysis (math, overlay on arXiv)
- Peer Community In journals (overlay on preprint servers)
- Advances in Combinatorics (overlay on arXiv)
- Emerging in GIS: potential for GIScience overlay journals
```

### Diamond Open Access

```
Diamond OA = Free for authors AND readers
- No APC
- No subscription fees
- Funded by institutions, societies, or grants

GIS Diamond OA journals:
- Geo-spatial Information Science
- JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software)
- JORS (Journal of Open Research Software)
- Cybergeo
- AGILE GIScience Series

Why Diamond OA matters:
- Removes financial barriers for authors
- Removes access barriers for readers
- No conflict of interest (publisher profit ≠ acceptance)
- Sustainable with community funding
```

### Emerging Publishing Models

| Model | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Overlay journals | Review preprints, no hosting | Growing |
| Modular publishing | Publish research components | Emerging (ResearchEquals) |
| Registered reports | Review design before results | Established in some fields |
| Micro-publications | Short, focused findings | Established (JOSS model) |
| Living papers | Continuously updated publications | Experimental |
| Data journals | Peer-reviewed dataset descriptions | Established (ESSD, SD) |
| Executable papers | Code runs within the paper | Experimental (Curvenote) |
| Post-publication review | Community review after publication | Growing (F1000, PubPeer) |
| AI-assisted review | AI tools support human reviewers | Early stage |
| Decentralized publishing | Blockchain-verified research | Experimental |
