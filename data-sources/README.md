# Data Sources

Comprehensive catalog of free and open geospatial data sources for GIS professionals, researchers, and developers.

> **Quick Picks**
> - **SOTA**: [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu) -- free Sentinel data with on-demand processing via openEO
> - **Free Best**: [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com) -- petabytes of free analysis-ready imagery for research
> - **Fastest Setup**: [Overture Maps](https://overturemaps.org) -- download GeoParquet vector data in minutes via DuckDB or Amazon S3

> **All sources listed are free or have free tiers.** Where relevant, we include SOTA commercial alternatives for comparison so you can make informed decisions.

### 2025-Era Formats and Standards

- **GeoParquet**: Column-oriented geospatial format for fast analytical queries (used by Overture Maps, Microsoft, etc.)
- **Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)**: HTTP range-request friendly raster format -- the standard for cloud-native imagery
- **STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog)**: JSON-based specification for searching and discovering geospatial assets across providers
- **FlatGeobuf**: Streaming-optimized binary vector format for web applications
- **PMTiles**: Single-file tile archive for serverless vector/raster tile hosting
